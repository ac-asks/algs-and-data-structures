# Algorithms & Data Structures (with Python)
Reminding myself that I am not naturally great at this but all it takes is practice, dedication and hard work. I made this repository to help me keep track of some of the questions / solutions I have done (mainly LeetCode).

- Think Like a Programmer (V. Anton Spraul) Recursion Problems

### My Learnings:
- use %10 to get the last digit
- use //10 to get the whole number without hte last digit 
- for the two above points, loop it until != 0
- *=2 is same as <<=1
- use list comprehension with joins
- use multiple pinters
- useful to use enumerate in Python
- head recursion is where the recursive call comes BEFORE other processing in the function (recursive call happens before the other processing)
- tail recursion is where the processing occurs BEFORE the recursive call - recursive call is the last step in the function (recursive call is postponed until the end)
